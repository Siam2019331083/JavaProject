# TANKMOPPER

I've created a game called Minesweeper. In this version, there are three levels.

1.The easy level is a 10 x 10 grid, with 10 tanks hidden.

2.The medium level is a 16 X 16 grid, with 40 tanks hidden.

3.The hard level is a 30 x 17 grid, with 99 tanks hidden.

Tankmopper is a game where tanks are hidden in a grid of squares. Safe squares have numbers telling you how many tanks touch the square. You can use the number clues to solve the game by opening all of the safe squares. If you click on a tank you lose the game!
